# python-webscraping
This is my first attempt at webscraping using BeautifulSoup4 module of python.

You know how sometimes, you feel like you are doing the same exercises over and over again in the gym and you feel like you need to add some variety into your workout ? Well this code helps you do that. The website used here is www.bodybuilding.com. Simply enter the body part you wish to work out and we scrape the website to bring you 15 different workouts for each body part. As an additional perk, I have added the exercise roulette feature. Simply add the number of workouts you wish to do for a single body part and we randomly choose that number of workouts from the list of scraped exercises :) :) Testing branch
